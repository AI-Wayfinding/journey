# Journey protocol v1

A **journey** is an encrypted team space. Its technical name in the package is **enclave**. This document covers the portable format; services and clients manage account sign-in, passkeys, caches, and delivery separately.

## Keys and records

Each person and agent has an X25519 age recipient. Agents can use non-extractable Web Crypto private keys; a person's exportable identity can be sealed to a passkey-backed age recipient outside this package. Each person also has an Ed25519 signing key. A random 256-bit journey key belongs to a numbered **epoch** (one generation of the key). It is age-wrapped separately for every current member and agent. Removal creates the next epoch and gives wraps only to those who remain. Existing records stay under their old keys.

Every item is an append-only encrypted version. The plain envelope is `{ outside: { v:1, id, journey, seq?, epoch, size, createdAt }, nonce, ciphertext }`, with base64 nonce and ciphertext. The outside has no record type. The nonce is 96 random bits; AES-GCM authenticates the ciphertext and all outside fields. The service must allocate `seq` before sealing if it wants a sequence there. `size` is the unencrypted UTF-8 JSON byte length, not the ciphertext length. The inside is `{ type, typeVersion, body }`, including optional unknown fields. Unknown types and unknown values remain intact when records are read and saved; known breaking versions can upgrade on read through registered converters. A client too old to meet the journey's signed minimum version may read but must not write.

Known inside types in version 1:

- `item`: `id, itemType, title, body, author, authoredBy, created, tags`, with optional `links: [{to,rel}]`, `replaces` (version identifier), `sharedFrom`, and `resourceKind`. Known item types include `position`, `interview`, `lesson`, and `resource`; new strings remain valid. `authoredBy` is `human`, `agent`, or `mixed`.
- `comment`: `id, item, onVersion, author, authoredBy, at, body`, with optional `inReplyTo`. Comments point to the version they discuss.
- `delete`: `target` records a deletion request. The service is responsible for deleting stored versions; a copy already held by someone cannot be erased remotely.

IDs are 26-character, time-sortable ULID-style strings from Web Crypto random bytes. Links and version identifiers use the same ID format. A search index is derived on a device and is not authoritative.

## Signed membership history

Clients verify entries in memory. A service must store them encrypted if member identifiers and grants are to remain hidden from the server. Entries are `{ v:1, seq, prev, at, actor, type, body, sig }`; genesis has sequence zero and `prev:null`. `prev` is base64 SHA-256 of the previous complete signed entry. Ed25519 signs the entry without `sig`: sort every object's keys by JavaScript code-unit order, keep arrays in their original order, render compact JSON, then encode UTF-8. Strings are base64-encoded for signatures and hashes. Invalid chains, signatures, or permissions stop verification at the failing sequence. New, unknown entry types stop with `client-too-old`; they are never ignored.

- `genesis` names the journey, its creator's public recipient and signing key, grants `members.manage` to that person, and records `mode:sealed`, `visibility:private`, and `minClientVersion`. The first key epoch is 1.
- `member.add` contains a member, their grants, and their kind. A person with `members.manage` adds people. Any person may add their own agent. An agent has `addedBy`, `scope:read|readwrite`, and optional `expiresAt`, and gets no management grant.
- `member.remove` names a member. A holder may remove any member; a person may remove themselves or their own agent. Removing a person always removes their agents as well. An agent cannot sign a membership change.
- `grant.add` and `grant.remove` change `members.manage` for people only. After **every** entry, at least one person must still hold it. A holder signs grant changes.
- `key.rotate` names the next epoch and a SHA-256 hash of a canonical, ID-sorted list of all remaining `[member ID, age recipient]` pairs. Only a holder signs. It does not itself carry the wrapped keys; clients must check the supplied wraps against the verified member list.
- `client.minVersion` raises or retains the minimum compatible client version. Versions are three dot-separated nonnegative integers, compared numerically. A holder signs it.

Visibility changes and team-defined types can add new signed entry types in later protocol versions. A client that does not recognize them must update before applying the log.

## Removal and export

`removeAndRotate` produces a signed removal entry, a signed next-epoch entry, a fresh key, and one age wrap per remaining member and agent. Removal can take effect before rotation is delivered; the service must then block old-key writes until a holder completes the update. The helper refuses self-removal because that person would no longer be able to sign the rotation; another holder must complete it. It cannot atomically deliver changes or enforce server access by itself.

An export is one age-encrypted JSON file with `log`, `envelopes`, and `wraps`. `importJourney` verifies membership signatures, the chain, and each envelope it can decrypt before returning the archive. Keep historic wraps if historic records must remain readable. An archive and the server can still withhold records or present a prior valid history; retain a separate checkpoint if detecting rollback matters.
